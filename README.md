# NQLib

[![Test NQLib](https://github.com/knttnk/NQLib/actions/workflows/test-python-package.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/knttnk/NQLib/actions/workflows/test-python-package.yml)

NQLib is a <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a> library to design noise shaping quantizer for discrete-valued input control.

## What can I do with NQLib?

In the real world, a dynamic system may have to be controlled by discrete-valued signals due to the inclusion of actuators that are driven by ON/OFF or network with capacity limitations. In such a case, a good output may be obtained by converting continuous-valued input to discrete-valued input with a quantizer designed by NQLib.

## Install

You can install NQLib by using pip

```sh
pip install nqlib
```

or conda.

```sh
conda install -c conda-forge nqlib
```
